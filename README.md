# Sprint 1

- Sprint Goal: Establish the project foundation, prototype core mechanics, and finalize the game's visual style.
- Estimated Points: 70/80
- Focus Areas:
- Game Engine Setup (10 points): Set up the Unity, configure project settings, and import necessary assets.
- Basic Ship Movement (20 points): Implement WASD-based movement for the spaceship, ensuring smooth and responsive controls.
- UI Mockups (10 points): Design basic UI elements (score, lives, pause menu) using wireframes or low-fidelity mockups.
- Art Style Exploration (20 points): Experiment with different visual styles for the game, creating concept art or mood boards for the spaceship, asteroids, diamonds, and backgrounds.
- Initial Level Prototyping (10 points): Create a very basic level layout to test ship movement, diamond collection, and asteroid collision mechanics.
**Additional Considerations**:
- Begin researching and selecting appropriate audio assets for sound effects and music.
- Start planning the technical architecture for the game (e.g., object pooling for asteroids and diamonds).
- Deliverables:

- Functional Prototype: A playable prototype showcasing the basic ship movement, diamond collection, and asteroid collision mechanics.
- UI Mockups: Low-fidelity mockups or wireframes for the game's UI elements.
- Art Style Direction: A clear visual direction for the game, established through concept art or mood boards.


  # Sprint 2

- Sprint Goal: Establish core gameplay loop, level progression, and ship controls.
- Estimated Points: 60/70
- Focus Areas:
- Map Creation (150 points): Design and implement the first few levels, incorporating basic environmental elements, navigational challenges, diamond placement, and asteroid patterns.
- Ship Controls (30 points): Develop WASD-based movement controls for the ship, ensuring smooth and responsive handling.
- Diamond Collection Mechanics (10 points): Implement the logic for collecting diamonds and updating the player's score.
- Asteroid Collision Mechanics (10 points): Implement collision detection and the logic for losing lives upon asteroid impact.
- Additional Considerations:
- Start planning for VFX and sound effects to enhance gameplay.
- Consider initial UI elements for displaying score, lives, and other relevant information.


# Sprint 3

 - Sprint Goal: Refine gameplay, add complexity, and prepare for alpha testing.
- Estimated Points: 50/70
Focus Areas:
- Level Design Refinement (20 points): Iterate on existing levels, add more complex challenges (e.g., moving asteroids, different types of diamonds), and introduce power-ups or special items.
- VFX Implementation (50 points): Integrate visual effects for explosions, impacts, diamond collection, and other gameplay elements.
- Sound Design (30 points): Add sound effects and music to enhance the player experience.
- Initial Post-Processing (50 points): Begin implementing basic post-processing effects (color grading, bloom) to improve visuals.
- Additional Considerations:
- Begin internal testing to identify and address bugs and balance issues.
- Plan for additional levels or game modes for future development.
**Key Changes**:

Removed enemy-related tasks (models, animations, logic) from the backlog, as the game focuses on asteroids and diamonds.
Adjusted the estimated points for each sprint to reflect the reduced scope of work.
Added tasks related to diamond collection and asteroid collision mechanics in Sprint 2.

- **Daily Scrum**: Daily Scrum toplantılarının zamansal sebeplerden ötürü WhatsApp üzerinden yapılmasına karar verilmiştir.
- Story'ler yapılacak işlere (task'lere) bölünmüştür. Miro Board'da gözüken kırmızı item'lar yapılacak işleri (task) gösterirken, mavi item'lar story'leri temsil etmektedir.

- **Sprint Review**: 
Alınan kararlar: Veritabanı oluşturması email ile toplanacak veriler için gerekli görülmüştür. Fakat bir yandan da veritabanı form sayfası için gerekli olmamıştır. O sebeple PBI bir sonraki sprint'e aktarılmıştır. Çıkan ürünün çalışmasında ve testlerinde bir problem görülmemiştir. Ekstra koyulması gereken özellikler belirlenmiştir. Sprint Review katılımcıları: ......

- **Sprint Retrospective:**
  - Takım içindeki görev dağılımıyla ilgili düzenleme yapılması kararı alınmıştır
  - Tahmin puanları gözden geçirilmeli ve sprint planlama toplantılarında gerekli geri bildirimlerin developer'lar tarafından verildiğine emin olunmalı
  - Unit test'ler için ayrılan efor/saat arttırılmalı
